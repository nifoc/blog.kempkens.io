Marco Arment's view on the rapid decline in Apple's software quality.

> I fear that Apple’s leadership doesn’t realize quite how badly and deeply their software flaws have damaged their reputation, because if they realized it, they’d make serious changes that don’t appear to be happening. Instead, the opposite appears to be happening: the pace of rapid updates on multiple product lines seems to be expanding and accelerating.

The post is being mentioned on quite a few finance sites and even on [CNBC](https://twitter.com/techcha/status/552135995361988608). Let's hope Apple listens.
