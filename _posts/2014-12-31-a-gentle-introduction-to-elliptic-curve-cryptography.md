A talk by djb and Tanja Lange.

> This talk will explain how to work with elliptic curves constructively to obtain secure and efficient implementations, and will highlight pitfalls that must be avoided when implementing elliptic-curve crypto (ECC). The talk will also explain what all the buzz in curve choices for TLS is about. This talk does not require any prior exposure to ECC.

The slides can be found [here](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2014/Fahrplan/system/attachments/2502/original/20141227-twopage.pdf) (CAcert) and the example source code is available [here](http://ecchacks.cr.yp.to).
