Over the weekend I watched some [DEF CON](https://www.defcon.org) videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/DEFCONConference/videos) and thought I should share some of the interesting ones on here. The two talks on Bitsquatting (by Stucke and Schultz) are especially entertaining and scary.

* [Evil DoS Attacks and Strong Defenses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPibf6C35E) by Sam Bowne and Matthew Prince
* [DNS May Be Hazardous to Your Health](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQqWzHKDnTI) by Robert Stucke
* [Examining the Bitsquatting Attack Surface](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QgRD1enaMw) by Jaeson Schultz
* [Java Every-days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noNcfyxnTh0) by Brian Gorenc and Jasiel Spelman
