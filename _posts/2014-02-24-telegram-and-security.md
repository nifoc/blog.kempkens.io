Every since [Facebook bought WhatsApp](http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/19/facebook-buying-whatsapp-for-16b-in-cash-and-stock-plus-3b-in-rsus/) more and more of the people I know switch to [Telegram](https://telegram.org). One of the main reasons they choose Telegram is because it's "secure" and Telegram itself seems really keen on being seen as secure, privacy-focused WhatsApp alternative.

People that are way smarter than I am when it comes to cryptography have a sligtly different opinion on the "secure, privacy-focused" part …

- [Telegram, AKA "Stand back, we have Math PhDs!"](http://unhandledexpression.com/2013/12/17/telegram-stand-back-we-know-maths/)
- [A Crypto Challenge For The Telegram Developers](http://thoughtcrime.org/blog/telegram-crypto-challenge/)
- [Telegram’s Cryptanalysis Contest](http://www.cryptofails.com/post/70546720222/telegrams-cryptanalysis-contest)

You know, at least WhatsApp does not claim to be secure.
