title: Some DEF CON Videos
---

Over the weekend I watched some [DEF CON](https://www.defcon.org) videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/DEFCONConference/videos) and thought I should share some of the interesting ones on here. The two talks on Bitsquatting (by Stucke and Schultz) are especially entertaining and scary.
